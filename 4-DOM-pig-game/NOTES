DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION ---

* DOM - Document Object Model. It is structured representation of HTML document.

* The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript.

* For each HTML tag, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with from our JS code.

* JS and DOM are two different things. There are special JS methods that allow us to interact and manipulate which means change the DOM and therfore webpage.

* The methods that are nothing but functions attached to some object and this object is called document object. This is the object that gives access to the DOM.

* The HTML webpage content is stored in the DOM, which can then be accessed and manipulated by JavaScript.
